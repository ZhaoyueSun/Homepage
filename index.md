title: Welcome to my blog

I'm a PhD student in Computer Science under the supervision of Prof. Yulan HeLink opens in a new window. I am interested in Natural Language Processing(NLP) and currently mainly focus on Event-Centric Natural Language Understanding.
I obtained my Master's and Bachelor's degree at Southeast University in software engineering. Before joining Warwick, I worked as a Junior NLP Researcher at iFLYTEK Research for a year.

In Proceedings of the 2022 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 5571â€“5587, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Association for Computational Linguistics.

On-going Research:
I'm currently working on a practical and interesting topic of pharmacovigilance event extraction, which aims to improve public health by discovering and reasoning adverse effect events from text data. The task is broadly relevant to many topics in NLP, such as information extraction, knowledge representation and causal inference etc., and would have a large space to explore. Any ideas will be welcomed for communication.
